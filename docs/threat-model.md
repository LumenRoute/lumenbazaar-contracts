# Threat Model

This document covers the `upto-session` contract and the example-only policy wallet. The custom
`test-token` exists only for local and testnet validation and is not a production asset.

The accepted funding design is
[ADR 0001: Escrow-Funded Upto Sessions](adr/0001-escrow-funded-upto-sessions.md).
The current source implements the selected escrow model. The corrected v2
testnet deployment and lifecycle evidence are published in
`deployments/testnet-2026-10-07.json` and
`artifacts/testnet/lifecycle-2026-10-07.json`. Live on-ledger rejection evidence for the current
interface v3 source is published in `deployments/testnet-2026-10-20.json` and
`artifacts/testnet/live-evidence-2026-10-20.json`.

## Assets and trust boundaries

- Buyers authorize full-cap escrow at session creation and cancellation for
  their own funds.
- Sellers authorize settlement and cannot settle more than the buyer's cap.
- Asset activation performs a bounded read-only probe of SEP-41 balance and
  metadata methods without moving funds, then emits an activation event. This
  rejects missing, reverting, and observably malformed contracts at that time.
- The configured token contract is trusted to implement SEP-41 transfer and
  balance semantics correctly. Escrow checks exact before/after balance deltas
  and rolls back on failed, under-reporting, or partial behavior, but a token
  that consistently fabricates every observed balance can defeat local
  reconciliation. Asset review and allowlisting remain mandatory.
- The `resource_hash` and `usage_hash` values are commitments only. The contract does not validate
  off-chain resource contents or metering calculations.
- RPC nodes, Horizon, indexers, backend services, and user interfaces are outside the on-chain trust
  boundary. Clients must verify finalized transaction results before presenting settlement as final.

## Authorization and replay

- `create_session` requires buyer authorization and binds buyer, seller, asset, cap, expiry, resource
  hash, and an incrementing sequence into the session ID. Its nested token call
  transfers the cap into contract custody.
- `settle` requires the stored seller's authorization and finalizes a session once.
- Before expiry, `cancel` requires the stored buyer's authorization, refunds the escrow, and prevents later settlement.
- At or after expiry, `recover_expired` requires no caller authorization and can refund only the stored buyer.
- Repeated settlement and cancellation attempts fail against finalized state.
- Soroban rejects a callback that tries to invoke the active escrow contract
  again while its token transfer is on the call stack. Test-only callback-token
  fixtures cover create, settle, cancel, and recovery and assert that no second
  success event, authorization, balance movement, or liability transition is
  produced. This regression evidence does not make arbitrary token behavior
  trustworthy.

## Amount, expiry, and storage risks

- Caps and settlement amounts must be positive, and settlement cannot exceed the stored cap.
  Settling exactly the cap is allowed; `actual_amount > max_amount` returns `#8 AmountExceedsCap`
  (`validate_settlement_amount` in `contracts/upto-session/src/validation.rs`).
- Expiry is ledger-sequence based, not timestamp based. `settle` and `cancel` reject when
  `ledger.sequence >= expires_at_ledger` with `#4 ExpiredSession` (`validate_settlement_amount`
  and `cancel` in `contracts/upto-session/src/lib.rs`), so the last ledger that can settle or cancel
  is `expires_at_ledger - 1`. `recover_expired` is allowed from `expires_at_ledger` onward.
- `settle` checks status, amount, cap, expiry, and usage hash before seller authorization, and
  `cancel` checks status and expiry before buyer authorization. A rejected call therefore reports the
  first failed rule.
- Live testnet evidence on contract `CDI5ZVB4VUQQJ5DJ25M4QBXYI273LN4PHN7TW6BT6VHERELK26SH7YY3`
  (`artifacts/testnet/live-evidence-2026-10-20.json`), all recorded as on-ledger transactions:
  - control settlement of 6,500,000 under a 10,000,000 cap succeeded at ledger 5290715
    (`ff15324bd866801ecdf1137e478eea7d63758982af4d77cf13a122f393cb49b5`);
  - settlement of 5,000,001 under a 5,000,000 cap failed with `Error(Contract, #8)` at ledger 5290735
    (`07bb7c118510a1fbaae89f504a9b1174c4c8baae78809186d640dfb7b7e28e73`) with identical balances,
    liability, and session state before and after;
  - for a session expiring at ledger 5290770, settlement succeeded in the last valid ledger 5290769
    (`596c4cdf087f7ed06581ee3ae692bd1a4ef499248e715658eaad043f305bf0f1`);
  - for a session expiring at ledger 5290800, settlement landing exactly in ledger 5290800 failed
    with `Error(Contract, #4)` (`bcbaa57fcf8bd6c21a9dfff5cc1680d522345490fd6fc52b85132025047c884e`)
    without mutating state, and the escrow was then recovered permissionlessly.
- Contract storage TTL can outlive or expire independently of off-chain records. Operators must not
  treat a missing off-chain record as proof that an on-chain session is absent.
- TTL extension is limited to open sessions. Tests cover missing, settled, cancelled, and expired
  session rejection. The public lifecycle evidence also covers settlement rejection at the live
  expiry boundary and permissionless recovery seven ledgers after expiry.

### Storage TTL boundary semantics

`contracts/upto-session/src/ttl_test.rs` pins these semantics with deterministic ledger tests.
Constants: threshold `DEFAULT_TTL_THRESHOLD = 100_000`, extension `TTL_EXTENSION_AMOUNT = 1_000_000`.
An entry's remaining TTL is `live_until_ledger - current_ledger`; `extend_ttl` raises it to the full
extension only when the remaining TTL is at or below the threshold.

| Storage | Keys | Extended by | Boundary behavior (entry written at ledger 0) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Instance (one shared TTL) | `Admin`, `AdminRotation`, `StorageLayoutVersion`, `SupportedAsset`, `AssetMaxSessionAmount`, `SupportedAssets`, `OperationalState`, `NextSessionSequence` | Admin entry points only (`initialize`, cap, rotation, asset lifecycle) | Ledger 899,999 (TTL 100,001): not extended. Ledger 900,000 (TTL 100,000): extended to 1,000,000. |
| Persistent | `Session(id)` | `create_session`, every finalizing write, and `extend_ttl` on open sessions | Same boundary as above. |
| Persistent | `Liability(asset)` | Alongside the session in the same calls | Same boundary as above. |

- `create_session`, `settle`, `cancel`, and `recover_expired` do not extend the instance entry, so
  the config and the session sequence rely on operators calling an admin entry point (for example
  re-setting the existing cap) before the instance TTL runs out.
- A session cannot logically expire later than `MAX_SESSION_DURATION_LEDGERS` (518,400) after
  creation, which is below the 900,000-ledger extension boundary. An open session therefore never
  needs `extend_ttl` before its logical expiry; extension only matters for keeping an expired,
  unrecovered session readable until recovery.
- `extend_ttl` is not gated by logical expiry: an open session at or after its expiry ledger can
  still be extended and then recovered. Settlement and cancellation at or after the expiry ledger
  fail with `ExpiredSession`; recovery before it fails with `SessionNotExpired`.
- Finalized sessions (settled, cancelled, expired) are never revived or reopened: `extend_ttl`
  fails with `TtlExtensionFailed`, leaves the TTL, state, balances, liability, and events unchanged.
  The only extension a finalized session sees happens inside its own finalizing write (for example
  recovery at the boundary ledger), which does not change its terminal status.
- Lapsed state fails closed. The unit-test host does not archive persistent entries, so tests model
  a lapsed entry by removing it. A missing session returns `SessionNotFound` from every entry point
  with no transfer or event. A missing `Liability` entry makes settlement, cancellation, and recovery
  fail with `LiabilityUnderflow` and leaves the escrow in the contract; it never pays out. Missing
  instance config returns `NotInitialized` for admin and new-session paths, while the stored buyer
  can still cancel an existing open session.
- Restoring archived entries is a network-level operation. This contract neither implements nor
  relies on it, and no restoration behavior is promised here.

## Administration and upgrades

- `upto-session` stores an administrator during one-time initialization but currently exposes no
  contract upgrade entry point.
- The administrator can authorize an `Active`/`Paused` operational transition with
  `pause_creation` and `resume_creation`. A pause stops new exposure by rejecting
  `create_session` before buyer authorization or any token transfer, while settlement,
  cancellation, expiry recovery, TTL extension, and read-only queries stay available so
  existing escrow cannot be trapped.
- Deployed instances are therefore operationally immutable through this interface. A code change
  requires a new deployment and explicit migration or reconfiguration by clients.
- The policy wallet owner can update its own spending policy. That authority does not grant access to
  another buyer's session or permit settlement by a different seller.

## Known limitations

- `upto` is a LumenBazaar extension and is not presented as an upstream-standard Stellar x402 scheme.
- The live evidence uses LBT, a custom test-only token, not Circle USDC or another production asset.
- The 2026-10-07 lifecycle rejections failed during simulation and therefore have no submitted
  transaction hash; that evidence records the observation ledger, exact command, and deterministic
  rejection instead. The 2026-10-20 live evidence submits rejected operations without simulation
  (using a valid sibling simulation's footprint), so each rejection is a failed transaction on ledger.
  A scheduled workflow re-verifies every published transaction and its expected outcome against
  Horizon.
- Testnet lifecycle evidence does not prove mainnet readiness, production monitoring, or backend
  idempotency.
- Production use requires an independently reviewed token, a live transaction submission client,
  durable backend idempotency, and monitoring for failed or delayed finality.
- The malicious-token suite demonstrates bounded behaviors, not safety against
  arbitrary token bytecode. Exact balance checks are defense in depth and do
  not remove the configured-asset trust boundary.
