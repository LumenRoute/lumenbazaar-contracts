# Test Token Contract

`test-token` is a local utility contract for LumenBazaar contract tests. It is
not part of the production capped-session payment path.

It implements only the helper surface needed for local tests:

- one-time admin initialization
- admin-only minting
- holder-authorized transfers
- balance inspection
- static token metadata

Production `upto-session` deployments should use the Stellar Asset Contract for
the configured SEP-41 asset. This package exists so workspace tests can exercise
local token behavior without depending on external token state.
